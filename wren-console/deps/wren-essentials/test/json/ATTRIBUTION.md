Tests and suite here are from the great `wren-json` project:

<https://github.com/brandly/wren-json>

- The tokenizing tests were commented out since we don't expose a tokenizer the same way
- `toBeARuntimeError` was modified to allow for the more generic tests that we provide

TODO

- perhaps replace with `wren-testie`?  Or maybe there is value in sharing the same suite?
